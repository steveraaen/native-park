This was compiled on 2019 Macbook Pro with 32gb memory, 2tb storage.
To resolve ruby conflicts (for installation of ios Cocoapods)
$ brew update
$ brew install ruby-build
$ brew install rbenv

$ rbenv install 2.7.5
$ rbenv global 2.7.5

After that, you need to export some configurations to define rbenv as default global ruby. For zsh users:

echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
And restart the terminal or run source ~/.zshrc.
